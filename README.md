# Weather-Monitoring
"A basic weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fetches real-time weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays key information: temperature, conditions, wind, humidity. Includes a user-friendly interface with city search. A good starting point for learning front-end development and interacting with APIs."
